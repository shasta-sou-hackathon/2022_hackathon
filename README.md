### Project:
Developed by: Peter Jacobson  
Idea Created By: Jeff & Peter Jacobson

I am creating the "Contractor Buddy". This program is designed to be used by a contractor, currently on supporting a roofer, to automate the process of generating a job cost report. The idea was given to be from my dad, Jeff, who runs a roofing business and has been working to automate the job cost system through less technical means. 

Usually a roofer will go to a sight take mesaurements, pictures, and other notes, then will have to go back to the office and fill out an excel sheet of what they need to order. Then they still have to create a job cost report from the information in the excel sheet, then finally after that estimate is made they will send an email or the customer with their bid. Even after all that, if the customer accepts the bid they still have to generate a contractor for the customer to sign. 

The Contract Buddy aims to automate the process so that the roofer is able to input all data on an ipad at the job sight and be able to immediatly generate a job cost and in later releases contracts for the customer to see the first time they meet the contractor. The goal of the contarctor buddy is to improve the efficeny of the roofer by allowing them to spend more time out in the field and less doing paper work in the office, increasing the number of customers they can reach. The contractor buddy will also allow for less experienced roofers to be able to give more accurate esimates as they will not need to know exact numbers for things like boxes of nails per square, the software will take care of that all.

Overall, the Contract Buddy will improve the efficency of roofers by automating the task of generating job cost reports on site.
